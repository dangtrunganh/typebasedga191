Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has revealed to using a carrot-and-stick method with Kimi Raikkonen to keep his desire to remain with the Maranello marque high
With Lewis Hamilton yet to sign his new contract as he negotiates the finer details with Mercedes  it has been suggested that the 30-year-old will replace Raikkonen at Ferrari for next season
The Finn  however  has arguably never been happier during his Formula One career courtesy of the atmosphere generated within the team by the arrival of the charismatic Arrivabene
In Sunday 's Bahrain Grand Prix  Raikkonen did exactly that  finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner-up to Hamilton
